# Organizi

A project that will be public and will grow further more.

# Why make this?

I am a person myself with is wondering what will happen with colaborative editing and so on, this project is to come the best one yet. Sure it will be archived sometime but who really knows! Am I right?

# Why on Github?

GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books.
Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

The information on Github is public and the platform is built for developers to share their newest creations.
That's why I choose Github.
